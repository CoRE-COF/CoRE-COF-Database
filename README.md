## Welcome to CoRE COF Database!

You can find solvent-free and disorder-free structure files of nearly all the experimental COFs published on literature here. Specially, COFs reported without the atomic coordinate files are constructed following the experimental information provided in the corresponding synthetic studies.
All the [structure file](https://github.com/core-cof/tttt/) are solvent-free and disorder-free, being suitable for direct use as input files for computational purpose.
